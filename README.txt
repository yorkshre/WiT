To compile this course you have to install Python and Sphinx

### On Linux
On every Linux Python should be installed on default. If not use command:

> sudo apt-get install python

If you have Python now you should install Sphinx

> sudo pip install -U Sphinx

### On Windows
https://www.python.org/downloads/ - download installer for your system

If you cannot run Python from console add path to environments variables. All information are on link below.
https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html#excursus-setting-environment-variables

If you can run Python from console, you can run pip too.

> sudo pip install -U Sphinx

Best Regards.
